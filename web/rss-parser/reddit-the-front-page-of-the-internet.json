When I heard the delivery truck pull up, I thought, 'oh cool' and then went back to my show. It just so happened that my mom ordered a lot of different parts for her car, and then she assumed the box was one of hers as well without checking the label since I hadn't mentioned ordering anything to her (obviously).\n According to my mom, she opened it, thought, 'oh, *my dad* must have bought something.' and then... she checked the label. And saw my name.\n Did she do the respectable thing and tape it back up with clear tape like nothing happened? Did she just hand it to me and walk away silently? No, she went to my dad. Because of course she did. According to my mom, she walked in, said, 'our daughter ordered sex toys and I don't know how to handle it' and my dad shot up in bed with horror. A moment later, he giggled and jumped out of bed, taking the box from her and saying, 'I want to give it to her!'\n He walks into my room. I say hey to him and sit up to look at him. He tilts the box towards me to show it's contents, and then we stare at each other in silence for several seconds before he sets it down next to me with the biggest grin on his face, and then calmly walks off.\n I can't look my parents in the face anymore. I might actually have to move out, COVID be damned because my dad won't stop making masturbation jokes. \n TL;DR\n I ordered two sex toys and lube off Amazon without realizing I had Prime, which meant that I didn't grab my package when it was delivered. My mom opened it, thinking it was hers, and then went to my dad for help. My dad is a monster, so he came into my room and stared at me while showing me the contents of the box, then set it down next to me and walked out. I think I'm getting an apartment soon.\n    submitted by    /u/ningensfriend    to    r/tifu  \n [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_jbfp84","isoDate":"2020-10-15T03:08:28.000Z"},{"title":"DAMWON Gaming vs.
