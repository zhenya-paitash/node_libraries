Bring Me the Horizon

Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where
Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where
I thought I'd buried you
And covered the tracks
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands
I thought I'd buried you
We're sinking, never die
I thought I cut you loose
Severed the feeling
I stepped through the crack as you clamp to my shirt
I thought I'd buried you
We're sinking, never die
Can you tell from the look in her eyes
We're going no where
We live our life like we're ready to die
We're going no where.
You can run but you'll never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where
This is sempiternal
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over, again and again
Rise from the dead you child
Secrets don't deplete till they come to the ground
Signal the sirens, rally the troops
Ladies and gentlemen
Its the moment of truth
Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where
You can run but never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where
Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where
You can run but never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where
This is sempiternal
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over, again and again
